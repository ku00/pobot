  "readme": "# hubot-heroku-keepalive\n\nA hubot script that keeps the hubot Heroko web dyno alive.\n\n## Installation\n\nIn hubot project repository, run:\n\n`npm install hubot-heroku-keepalive --save`\n\nThen add **hubot-heroku-keepalive** to your `external-scripts.json`:\n\n```json\n[\n  \"hubot-heroku-keepalive\"\n]\n```\n\n## Configuring\n\nhubot-heroku-keepalive is configured by two environment variables:\n\n* HUBOT_HEROKU_KEEPALIVE_URL - the URL to keepalive\n* HUBOT_HEROKU_KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL - the interval in which to keepalive, in minutes\n\nFor hubot-heroku-keepalive to be useful, you *must* at least set\nHUBOT_HEROKU_KEEPALIVE_URL. You can find out the value for this by using the\n[Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/):\n\n```\nheroku apps:info\n```\n\nCopy the `Web URL`, and then `config:set` HUBOT_HEROKU_KEEPALIVE_URL:\n\n```\nheroku config:set HUBOT_HEROKU_KEEPALIVE_URL=PASTE_WEB_URL_HERE\n```\n\nIf you want to trust a shell snippet from the Internet, here's a one-liner:\n\n```\nheroku config:set HUBOT_HEROKU_KEEPALIVE_URL=$(heroku apps:info -s  | grep web_url | cut -d= -f2)`\n```\n\n## Legacy Support\n\nHubot has for a long time had it's own builtin way to keep its web dyno alive,\nbut this is an extraction of that behavior.\n\nThe legacy support uses the `HEROKU_URL` environment variable instead of\n`HUBOT_HEROKU_KEEPALIVE_URL`, so for forward compatability,\nhubot-heroku-keepalive will also use HEROKU_URL if it's present, and will\nalso disable the legacy keepalive behavior if it's present.\n\n## Development\n\nThe best way is to use `npm link` and make sure to point HUBOT_HEROKU_KEEPALIVE_URL at the right place:\n\n```\nhubot-heroku-keepalive$ npm link\nhubot-heroku-keepalive$ cd /path/to/your/hubot\nhubot$ npm link hubot-heroku-keepalive\nhubot$ export HUBOT_HEROKU_KEEPALIVE_URL=http://localhost:8080/\nhubot$ bin/hubot\n",
